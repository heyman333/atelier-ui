## Design Example

This example showcases a fashion e-commerce app designed with Atelier UI principles:

- **Bold Typography** — "GET READY TO SLAY IN STYLE" demonstrates confident, editorial-style headlines
- **Dark & Light Contrast** — Strategic use of dark cards against light backgrounds creates visual depth
- **Accent Color Strategy** — Yellow serves as a cohesive accent throughout, from clothing imagery to UI elements
- **Minimal UI Chrome** — Clean buttons, subtle icons, and text-based navigation reduce visual noise
- **Card-Based Layout** — Rounded corners and generous padding create a premium, tactile feel
- **Whitespace as Design** — Intentional breathing room guides the eye and elevates content

## Design Principles

- **Typography-first** — Large, expressive headlines with strong visual hierarchy
- **Monochrome foundation** — White, off-white, black, charcoal, beige
- **Editorial tension** — Intentional asymmetry, broken grids, generous whitespace
- **Minimal affordances** — Flat buttons, text-based actions, trust user intuition
- **Subtle motion** — Opacity, translate, scale ≤ 1.05. No bounce or spring.
